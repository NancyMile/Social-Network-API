# Social-Network-API

 API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN you enter the command to invoke the application
THEN your server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN you open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes will be displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN you will be able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database
WHEN you test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN you will be able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```
